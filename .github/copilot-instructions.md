# Copilot Instructions for This Project

## Project Overview
This project consists of a series of HTML files (week1.html to week12.html and index.html) and various image assets. It appears to be a collection of weekly deliverables or lessons, possibly for an educational or design-related course. There is no build system, package manager, or code-based backend—everything is static.

## Key Patterns and Conventions
- **HTML-Only:** All logic and content are in static HTML files. There is no JavaScript, CSS, or external framework present in the codebase.
- **Weekly Structure:** Each `weekX.html` file likely represents a separate week or module. These files are independent and may have similar structure or content patterns.
- **Image Assets:** Images are used for design references, mockups, or documentation. They are not programmatically referenced (no code links).
- **No Automation:** There are no scripts for building, testing, or deploying. All editing is manual.
- **Naming:** File and image names are descriptive and often include spaces, numbers, or special characters. Maintain this convention when adding new files.

## Productivity Tips for AI Agents
- When adding new weeks, copy the structure of an existing `weekX.html` file for consistency.
- Reference images by their exact filename, including spaces and special characters.
- Do not introduce JavaScript, CSS, or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Keep all new content in the root directory, following the current flat structure.
- If updating multiple weeks, ensure consistency in layout and navigation between files.

## Example: Adding a New Week
1. Duplicate an existing `weekX.html` file (e.g., `week12.html`).
2. Rename to `week13.html`.
3. Update the content as needed, maintaining the same structure.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Likely the main entry point or overview.
- `week1.html` to `week12.html`: Weekly deliverables or lessons.
- Image files: Used for visual references, not code assets.

## What Not to Do
- Do not add build tools, package files, or scripts.
- Do not restructure folders or move files unless instructed.
- Do not add code that requires a runtime environment.
